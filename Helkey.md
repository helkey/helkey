Work History
----------

2016-Present
:   <i>Program Manager</i> - UC Santa Barbara

    Supervise research, give presentations, write research proposals, technical papers and research reports.

2011-2016
:   <i>Software Engineer</i> - Calient Technologies

    Developed software to lower cost of manufacturing optical switches, saved $18M over 5 years. 

2008-2011

    . . .


Remote Work Experience
------------
Self-motivated and self-directed - 3 years working remote location from manager and co-workers, 
  communicating mostly by video conference and electronic communication.


Education
---------
<i>B.S. in Engineering</i>, California Institute of Technology\
<i>Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering</i>, University of California, Santa Barbara


Projects
------------
Python
:    - Developed software/hardware to reduce cost of rate-limiting manufacturing step by 100x 
     (test time down 10x, test equipment cost reduced <10x).
	 Led 2-person team, wrote all of the backend software, performed the testing, 
	 system integration, and on-going support. Implemented performance/yield tracking.\


     - Algorithm implementation to reduce time for switch collimator alignment time by 10x.


Go
:   - Backend software for designing integrated photonics (routing layers, undo/redo buffer, read/write GDS files)\


    - Algorithm implementations (e.g. [Sudoku solver](https://github.com/helkey/sudoku-go/)
	(github.com/helkey/sudoku-go/),...)

Python / HTML / CSS
:   - Translate Balsamiq wireframes to web pages, including Javascript for customizing theme.

C
:   - Embedded software for low-power sensor system using energy harvesting, MSP430 microprocessor. 


FPGA
:   - Optimized algorithms for WiMAX baseband processing, image processing.
