Projects
------------
Go
:   - (AWS) Distributed sysytems for [URL shortening](https://github.com/helkey/url-shorten) using Terraform for resource provisioning, Packer for containers.

    - Backend software for designing integrated photonics (waveguide layers, undo/redo buffer, read/write GDS files...)

    - [Algorithm implementations](https://github.com/helkey/algorithm-go) (e.g. [Backtracking](https://github.com/helkey/sudoku-go/), dynamic programming,...)
 
Python
:    - Developed software/hardware to reduce cost of rate-limiting manufacturing step by 100x 
            (test time down 10x, test equipment cost reduced 10x).
	 Led 2-person team, wrote all of the backend software, performed the testing, 
	 system integration, and operations support.

     - Developed algorithm to reduce process time of switch collimator alignment time by 10x.

     - Performance/yield tracking: Analyze production yield and flag problems using statistical process control.
       Designed database tables and implemented database schemas.

     - (Javascript/HTML/CSS) Translate Balsamiq wireframes to HTML web pages; Color picker for optimizing CSS themes.

C
:   - Interrupt-driven embedded software for low-power sensor system using energy harvesting

FPGA
:   - Developed digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms for WiMAX baseband processing, image processing.
