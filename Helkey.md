<i>B.S. in Engineering</i>, California Institute of Technology\
<i>Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering</i>, University of California, Santa Barbara


Projects
------------
Go
:   - (AWS) Distributed software for [URL shortening](github.com/helkey/url-shorten) using Terraform for resource provisioning, Packer for containers.

    - Backend software for designing integrated photonics (routing layers, undo/redo buffer, read/write GDS files)

    - [Algorithm implementations](github.com/helkey/algorithm-go) (e.g. [Backtracking](https://github.com/helkey/sudoku-go/), dynamic programming,...)
 
Python
:    - Developed software/hardware to reduce cost of rate-limiting manufacturing step by 100x 
            (test time down 10x, test equipment cost reduced <10x).
	 Led 2-person team, wrote all of the backend software, performed the testing, 
	 system integration, and on-going support.

     - Developed algorithm to reduce process time of switch collimator alignment time by 10x.

     - Performance/yield tracking: Analyze production yield and flag problems using statistical process control. Designed database tables and implemented database schemas.

     - (Javascript/HTML/CSS) Translate Balsamiq wireframes to HTML web pages; Color picker for optimizing CSS themes.

C
:   - Embedded software for low-power sensor system using energy harvesting, MSP430 microprocessor.
